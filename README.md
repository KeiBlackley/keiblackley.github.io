GitHub Pages hosted website for user KeiBlackley - [View Live](https://keiblackley.github.io)

This website outlines a portfolio for projects designed and created by this user. It also contains public global assets to be used/tested on projects.

## Table of Contents

  - [JavaScript](#js-assets)
## Assets
Stores all assets for the `keiblackley.github.io` project and all other web projects. This is done by using globally made asset files.

### Asset Examples
HTML Webpages inside `html_examples/` showcase the use of CSS and JS assets. You can also view most of these on my [CodePen Account](https://codepen.io/KeiBlackley).

> If viewing locally, *elements.html* can be a cheatsheet for what defines global styles

### Images
Public images are stored on this website for easier testing on `keiblackley.github.io`, `KBCOM` and `further developments`.

- **Example:** `assets/images/placeholder/upload-image-icon.png` - upload image button
<details>
<summary> View Placeholder Example </summary>
<img src="assets/images/placeholder/upload-image-icon.png" alt="Placeholder Example Image" />
</details>

### CSS Assets
Stylesheets that can be used globally and don't effect actual design of webpages are stored here for functionality.

- **Example:** `assets/css/global.css` - reset and define default style
<details>
<summary> View Example CSS </summary>
<pre><code>/* Example not effecting styling */
a:link, a:visited { color: darken(inherit, 10%); text-decoration: none; }
a:hover { opacity: 0.8; }</code></pre>
</details>

### JS Assets
Same as `CSS Assets` - scripts that can be used globally and don't effect the webpage(s) are stored here for functionality.
